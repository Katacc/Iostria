## 2 DEATH AND THE GREAT MIST
<hr style="margin-top: -2px;">

[Contents](#Contents)



When a person dies their soul will either be called upon by one of the gods or if none of them accept it, it will wake up and linger in a realm called the Great mist until Death reaps it for himself.

The great mist is a realm that to the normal soul seems like a vast grey emptiness filled with a thick mist, a sort of purgatory. It is said that the mist is so dense that even the flow of time lost its way, and so it is that time doesn’t flow naturally within the mist, instead it flows randomly in different directions.

Once a soul is sent there it is destined to wander around aimlessly until it is reaped by Death. There are however other beings that travel the mist for their own reasons, such beings are called “mist walkers” and they are able to interact with these wandering souls. They are usually creatures that have trained their whole life to be able to walk in the mist without getting lost. They are powerful mages and druids.

Usually mist walkers are wise and careful and manage to return to the realm of the living but sometimes they get lost in the Great mist and become trapped there and once you are lost it is nearly impossible to find a way back. These creatures are forced to travel the mist for eternity's looking for a way out and hiding from Death who also travels in the mist claiming lost souls.

In Iostria Death is not a god per say but they do possess some god-like powers.
Some call Death a “curse” but some realize that they are a necessity.

Izotl created Death from the first mortal eons ago. He commanded them to reap the unworthy of their souls until someone strong enough relieved Death of their duties. He made it so that Death is unphased by the passing of time and is not affected by mortal disease, but he is not immortal Death can be killed by means of steel or magic, though only by mortals. Izotl created Death to not be affected by any of the other gods and vice versa Death cannot harm any being of divine origin and they can’t harm him. 

The person to defeat Death in combat will become Death and absorb not only his powers but also the knowledge of all the Deaths that came before. And only by being relieved of their duties can the old Death's soul be released to the great beyond.

Why someone would want to become Death is for reasons of their own, maybe they seek to free the soul of a loved one or maybe they seek eternal life. 

A person's soul will end up in Death’s realm if it has wandered the great mist for long enough and none of the gods called upon it. Or if it was killed through unnatural ways such as a necromantic ritual which will make the soul invisible to the gods making it impossible for them to see it.

Once a person is sent to Death’s realm their soul will become apart of the great monstrosity that guards Death and their realm and the only one that can  save a soul that has become one with the monstrosity is Death themselves.

If a soul is strong enough they might be able to catch Death’s attention before they are consumed by the monstrosity and they  can try to bargain with Death  for their soul, Death can send them back in to the living realm as a hollow one to complete a task for him and upon the completion he can return their soul or grant them power. This is how the great pirate legend Edward 'The undead' Thorn got his status as a sort of demigod.

The “better” afterlife

If a person has lived a life that the gods deem worthy, their soul will be called upon after its death to become one with their god's soul. a god's power and their character is defined by the souls they absorb. The more powerful the soul the more impact it has on the gods.



## 3 DEMIGODS
<hr style="margin-top: -2px;">

[Contents](#Contents)


### Edward 'The undead' Thorn

Edward was a great pirate lord before he drowned with his ship in a massive storm. He died and was sent to Death’s realm where he was able to strike a deal with death to go back to the living realm and defeat sea monstrosities created by Dhemes. Sherborn was able to complete his mission so in return Death gave him his soul back and he was given immense power making him a “demigod” df
He is worshipped by the pirates of Barataria bay and according to legend he sails the seas even today hunting sea monsters.


### The Monstrosities

The monstrosities created by Dhemes are beings of great strength and size, they are unintelligent beings mostly driven by their basic instinct of hunger, they were made by the mad one in some sort of  experiment for unknown reasons.

It is not known exactly how many of these creatures still exist in Iostria, but every now and then there are stories told in inns across the continent about great beasts wandering the wilderness wreaking havoc on unsuspecting settlements.
Some consider these monstrosities "demigods” because of their raw strength they are worshipped by some orc tribes and barbarians. Killing one of these monstrosities is nearly impossible and is considered a test to becoming a true legend in Iostria.

#### Yuan-ti
Yuan-ti is a gigantic serpent that's said to live somewhere deep within the phantasmal forest.  It used to wander around devouring entire villages until it took residence in a cave that has now became its lair, some tribes within the phantasmal forest started worshipping the serpent as a god of primal nature unknowing of its true origins.

These tribes bring sacrifices to the serpent's lair to keep his hunger in check, so that it doesn’t start rampaging once more. These tribes have been worshipping the serpent for many millenium and they have been affected by its powers. Modern tribesmen have been physically deformed by Yuan-ti’s power. They are  somewhere in between human and serpent, they have also lost most of their humanity, mostly acting on their animalistic instincts. They still live in tribes where most of them hunt food and bring it to Yuan-ti’s lair.

 It is very rare to see one of these tribes' people but they have sometimes been seen on the edges of the phantasmal forest. They are very aggressive towards other creatures and will try to kill and bring back anything living they find.

## 4 LARGE CITIES & NOTABLE PLACES
<hr style="margin-top: -2px;">

[Contents](#Contents)


### Airedale
[Contents](#Contents)


Is the largest city in Iostria and is the capital of the Kingdom of Oceiros its population is roughly:  30 000, 70% human, around 10% dwarf, 5% elf, 5% halfling and 10% mixed of all the other races. 

Airedale consist of five official districts:
8The inner castle where the extremely wealthy and the important live with the King and the ones near him. The central garrison is also inside the inner castle

The upper class district (name pending) where the wealthy merchants and other successful business owners live.

The market district  (name pending) consists of huge market squares, large shop houses and many high quality inns.

The docks are a massive part of Airedales economy so there are many garrisons filled with guards there. The dock itself is also very large, fitting dozens of massive ships filled with goods. Many nice inns and brothels also exist within the dock district mostly filled with travellers and newcomers and from the other continents.

The middle class district (name pending) Is mostly full of large buildings with housing for the working class citizens, and some cheap low level taverns and inns.

The slums exist outside the city walls consisting of many large campsites that move around because settlements outside the city walls are illegal. The people within are largely beggars, workers too poor to afford housing inside the walls or criminals. For obvious reasons the slums are a very dangerous area with little to none city guard presence, so a large part of the city's crime is based here. Once a campsite gets large enough the city guards will come and tear it down trying to get rid of the people that live there, but overtime the people of the slums have learned to keep the campsite moving in the city's surroundings to avoid getting caught.

The city’s main entrances are either through the docks or the main gate. Both of these ways are always full of travellers and merchants trying to either leave or enter. Both of the official entrances  have heavy guard presence and security checkpoints. There are however other riskier ways into the city through the smugglers that live in the slums outside of the city.

Airedales economy is based mostly on its large dock district and the exports and imports to and from the other continents. There are also heavy taxes on all sorts of businesses within the city.

Airedales and the whole kingdom's official religion is to the light pantheon of gods and mostly to Zodlios. Other religions aren’t banned in the kingdom but they are often frowned upon and vandalism of churches and other places of worship to the other gods is not uncommon, also there have been rumours that famous supporters of the dark pantheon have been disappearing without trace. Despite this many underground communities of worship to the other gods exist within Airedale and the whole kingdom.


### The King
[Contents](#Contents)


The kingdom was ruled by the old King Artorias V, who was a wise and mostly peaceful ruler. The royal family consisted of King Artorias, Queen Priscilla and their son Prince Artorias VI. When the prince was only four years old the Queen became severely ill and after six months of struggle died of her illness. After a while the King got remarried to Queen Sylvia, and had a second son Prince Oceiros. Things were mostly good and the two Princes grew up together. Prince Artorias grew up a fierce warrior who had the respect of the people and of his father the king. Prince Oceiros grew up living in the shadow of his older half-brother and slowly got tired of his brother always getting all the attention and he started to despise him. People called Artorias the future king and this only helped fuel Oceiros’s  secret hatred for him. The Queen also secretly hated Prince Artorias as he was first in line for the throne but she wanted her son to take the throne instead. 

Once Prince Artorias was around 21 years of age and Oceiros was around 16, The king along with Prince Artorias went on a business trip to Stratham. Seeing the opportunity arise the Queen and the younger Prince decided to act. They hired a group of mercenaries to ambush the King's escort near the entrance of the Phantasmal forest. The mercenaries killed everyone but Prince Artorias who was left alive. When the Prince returned to Airedale to tell the news about the King’s death, he found that the Queen and Prince Oceiros both accused him of murdering his father the King. After the news of the Kings death were out, the Queen temperarily gained control of the throne, and used the power to have Prince Artorias publicly accused and shamed for the murder of the King. After this Prince Artorias was exiled for life and Prince Oceiros was declared the new King.

Currently King Oceiros has ruled the kingdom for around a year with his mother Sylvia working as his right hand. They have already started making plans to increase the kingdom's influence all over the continent. Unless they are stopped the continent could be consumed by war.


After Prince Artorias and the men few loyal to him were exiled they have set up a camp near Mirfield and are gathering loyal soldiers to try and overthrow his half-brother. And reclaim his seat as the rightful ruler of the Kingdom. Currently Artorias’s camp is around 500 warriors strong. 


### Stratham
[Contents](#Contents)


Population:
9 000

Stratham resides in the middle of The lost desert. The city’s population consists mostly of Mages and Sorcerers, but there are some scientists and nobles that live there. Stratham does not have one common god. Everybody believes in what they try to achieve from Magic. Many scientists choose not to believe in any god. Some of them even try to prove that gods don't exist.

Stratham is led by Arch Mages of Iostria. And their base of operations is Stratham Magic Academy, where Mages, Sorcerers and Scholars study their own arts.

The city has its own Guard, consisting of mages and sorcerers, which is the reason there are hardly any criminals. 

Stratham does not seize “wrong believers”. There are lots of other scientists that try to bend the laws of physics.

There are lots of shops and inns in Stratham and you can find every basic equipment. There are some special magic shops and identifiers where you can shop and explore large vast amounts of different magical items and spells.

Stratham Magic Academy is a large stone castle on the outskirts of the city, with 4 different buildings for magic wielders, all connected to the big main hall where the leaders reside.

Main Hall
Consist of big catering area, Main hall, Arch mage hall, Big library
Buildings for mages, sorcerers and scholars
Each of them consists of Main hall, Library optimised for their corresponding arts, Lots of classrooms, multiple Training halls and rooms for students.
Research hall and tower
Consists of multiple floors of different kinds of experimenting zones, classrooms, training hall and on top of the tower there is a teleportation experimenting zone.

The road to Stratham isn’t the easiest. If  you wish to travel to Stratham the only real way is to take one of the many river boats and travel to the edge of the desert. But the hardship doesn't end there. Along the long desert roads there are monsters lurking on the road, trying to survive in the heat of the desert, as well as scammers and robbers trying to get rich, and of course the sandstorms induced by the strong desert winds are easy to get lost in.



### Claton
[Contents](#Contents)


Is the Kingdom's trade centre and it consists of many towns and villages built around a central city that is a hub for trade. Claton is under the Kingdom's direct command and follows laws set by the Kingdom and pay’s taxes to the Kingdom. Because of this the city guards are a part of the Kingdom's army and there are many garrisons of soldiers in and around Claton.

Claton’s population is around 16 000 of which 45% are Humans, 10% Halflings, 12% Elves, 5% Tabaxis, 3% Firbolgs, 25% other creatures from the woods.

Claton is located north-west from Airedale near a crossing point in the traveller’s path in between The phantasmal forest and The fishermans bay, and so it is a place where the kingdom sells its goods to the rest of the continent. It also serves as a waypoint for travellers during their journey.

Claton is also the largest agricultural city of Iostria with most of the nearby villages consisting of farms growing crops from wheat & barley to cotton & hemp, and everything in between. It is also the closest city to the fishermans bay and so most of the fishermen from the numerous fishing villages come to Claton to sell their catch. Thus the central market square of Claton is the second largest in Iostria losing only to the market located in Mirfield. 

Unlike the capital of Airedale, Claton is not surrounded by walls, so the passage in and out of town is much easier and doesn’t have checkpoints. But still all the merchants that seek to sell their goods in the grand market are required to get a permit from the town hall and pay a percentage of their earnings selling at the market to the Kingdom as tax, also their goods are checked by the city guard every time when they open their stalls.

Claton’s economy is based mostly on the sales of crops from the farms and the fish sold by the fishermen. It also sells forward the goods imported by the kingdom from other continents, in the market

Everything basic and less basic can be bought from the numerous shops and stalls around the market square. 


### Klarth
[Contents](#Contents)


Is an ancient city built by dwarves millenia ago. It’s located in northern central Iostria just beyond The tribal valley. Klarth was originally built as a dwarven fortress during ancient times and so half of the city has been carved into the mountainside. Klarth is famous across all the continents for their master smithing work, they forge the best equipment in iostria built from one of the most sought after materials: Dragonium. 

Klarth is the home of around 7000 people of which 80% are dwarves and 20% are other races, most of them being merchants and sailors that export goods from the docks to other parts of Iostria.

Inside the mountain itself the city has been constructed to dwarven dimensions so the roofs are only about 5 feet high. Most of the city's scholars and the more wealthy live within the mountain as well as the royal family of Klarth. 

Nearly all of Klarth’s economy is based on the export of weapons, armor and other equipment. Though it is well known that the already high price of Klarth forged steel is brought even higher by the fact that the only trading routes to Klarth are either through The tribal valley or by sailing all around Iostria and risking pirates. Both extremely risky and dangerous, but there is a lot of coin to be made, so some merchants still take their chances.

Getting into Klarth itself is another problem if you even manage to get there. The city is walled off and the entrances are guarded by the royal dwarf army. To get into the city you must have a good reason or a merchants pass. All illegal contraband is seized at the city’s gate, and you are also searched when leaving the city. Once you are inside the city walls Klarth is mostly an accepting place for travellers and merchants. There are even many inns and taverns built for human sized creatures. Getting into the inner city located in the mountainside is nearly impossible if you don’t live there or have an invitation from someone that does. Security at the inner gates is even tighter and civilians aren’t allowed to bring weapons inside the inner city.


### Mirfield
[Contents](#Contents)


Is the single largest trading post in all of Iostria. Around 11 000 people live within Mirfield and thousands more in the smaller towns around it.

 Mirfield is the most diverse city in Iostria with around 22% humans, 15% dwarves, 10% halflings, 8% elves,  5% gnomes, 5% tabaxi, 5% tortles, 3% kenkus, 2% tieflings, and the remaining 25% being a mixture of all the other races in Iostria, Mirfield is one of the only large cities where orcs aren’t treated with open hostility and even some orc adventurers can be found in Mirfield.

 Nearly all of its economy is based on trade and the large corporations that call Mirfield their home. Unlike the other cities Mirfield isn’t confined behind walls or legislations, it is a sort of tax haven where many have made a lot of gold through somewhat shady means.  

Mirfield is run by a council that consist of the leaders of the largest companies that’s headquarters are within Mirfield. It's not a lawless place by any means, the city guard is a formidable group of mercenaries that defend the city as well as enforce the laws that are set by the council.

The council rules from the top floor of the largest building in the center of Mirfield. It's a massive trading house with hundreds of different size shops inside it. And just outside is the biggest market square in the continent, with countless rotating merchants from all over Iostria selling goods from their stands. Pretty much anything can be bought here from armor and artifacts to fine wine and childrens toys.

 Around Mirfield there are many towns both up and down on the traveler's path.


### Everwinter
[Contents](#Contents)


This scarce and snowy place is the most northern city on the continent. It guards the entrance to the mountains and the wilderness in the north. Everwinter is a mining town with nearly all of its economy being based on the exports of resources.

The mountains around Everwinter are the most ore rich ground that has been found in Iostria and it contains many rare elements including Dragonium the most sought after metal in Iostria. Other ores can be found in the mountains such as  Iron, copper, Gold, Nickel, Electrum, Silver. Even some gemstones have been found in the mountains.  

Everwinter has around 12,000 inhabitants, 42% humans, 16% dwarves, 9% half-orcs, 8% thieflings, 5% gnomes, 2% dragonborns, and 18% other races. It has the largest concentration of tieflings and dragonborn on the continent.


### Zoavoarren
[Contents](#Contents)


City of dragonborn, hidden from everything inside the mountains of the island of the dragons. The mountains hide around 1,300 dragonborn and their ancient civilization runs on the very foundation of our world, magma. The Mountains hide a lot of Dragonium, the rarest metal in the continent.

The depths of the mountais hides a massive portal between worlds, The portal to **underworld**. A magical barrier splits the over- and underworld and can be clearly seen through. The barriers keeps visitors away from both of the dimensions, but some beings have found a way to go through. One of the heroe's of the overworld, Wrarith, came thought the portal to save the world from a calamity.


### The traveler’s path
[Contents](#Contents)


Is the main road connecting most of Iostria with itself. The name comes from the builders who are believed to have been ancient travelers exploring the continent.  

Today the path is the busiest trading route in Iostria with many merchants traveling to and from all the major cities and towns. 

Some cities fights for the control of the route.


### The phantasmal forest
[Contents](#Contents)


Is the largest single forest in Iostria, located just north-east of Claton. It's the home to many small villages and even some towns lay hidden in the trees, most of them are “normal” settlements with travelers and merchants visiting the inns and trading with the locals. But some of the villages deep within the woods have no contact with the outside world. They live off the forest eating the many edible plants and the berries or by hunting some of the many animals in the forest.  

Many races hail from the phantasmal forest such as the Tabaxi, the Firbolgs, the wood elves, and the forest gnomes. Its total population is unknown but at least some thousands of creatures live there. 

A large problem in recent years has been that groups of bandits that hide in the trees in  the forest ambush lone travelers and merchants that walk on the Traveler’s path.

The phantasmal forest is said to be a magical place with many forest druids practicing their magic there, it's also said to be the home of the first mist walkers.

> Legend says, that there lies hidden portal to another plane of existence, somewhere deep within Phantasmal Forest


### The simmering swamp
[Contents](#Contents)


Located in a volcanically active part of  Iostria the simmering swamp lies in between the lost desert and the mountains north of Barataria Bay.

 Because of its location the waters of the simmering swamp are heated through geothermal geysers. The unfortunate side-effect is that the whole swamp, besides smelling like a swamp, also reeks of sulfur and volcanic fumes. One can get used to the smell as proved by the inhabitants of the simmering swamp. There are many small floating villages that are built on rafts, and they can float around the swamp area if need be. Most of the creatures living in the swamp are tortles but there are also many other races that live among them.


### The lost desert 
[Contents](#Contents)


Is known for its many magical treasures found in the many ruins and ancient tombs scattered around the desert. It’s considered the most magically sensitive place in Iostria and so the mage capital of Stratham was built there. 


### The tribal valley
[Contents](#Contents)


Is a giant valley in central Iostria that stands before the entrance to Klarth. Most of Iostria’s orcs, giants, goblins and barbarian clans live there, thus most people steer clear of it. 

Many armies have tried to conquer the tribal valley, all of them have failed. Many travellers every year go missing there never to be seen again, most of them searching for the same thing, a safe trade route to Klarth. Every merchant in the continent wants to get their hands on an easier trading route to Klarth, so they could sell the equipment forged by the dwarven master smiths. The only known trade route to Klarth today is by sea and even then you have to risk sailing through pirate waters.


### The fishermans bay
[Contents](#Contents)


Is the bay area located south-west of Claton. It is the most sea life rich place in Iostria. Thus there are numerous towns and villages along the shoreline that live off fishing in these waters.

Most of the fishermen in these towns travel to Claton to sell their catch. These towns and villages happily accept travelers and most of them have inns and places to spend the night. Some of the other villages along the coast however refuse to trade with the rest of the continent and live a self-sustained life  by fishing and farming for themselves. They are unwelcoming to all travellers and some even might be openly hostile to outsiders.

It is legend that the reason for the abnormally large amount of fish in these waters is that the remains of one of the sea monstrosities slain by Edward 'The undead' Thorn are located somewhere in the depths of the bay, and all of the sea life thrives either by eating the remains itself, or by hunting the smaller fish that do. This story is unconfirmed however and so it is unknown if it is the actual reason for the rich sea life in the area.


### Barataria Bay
[Contents](#Contents)


Barataria Bay is not recognized by the kingdom of Airedale as an official city, but rather as a rebel camp of pirates and outlaws, but in reality it is far from it. Barataria Bay is a collection of large towns and villages with a population of around 9000. It is a semi “lawless place” ruled by a council of democratically elected pirate lords who set the laws and collect taxes.


There is no limit to how long a person can sit on the council, but whenever a respected member of the community feels that someone on the council is unworthy of the seat they can challenge them to a re-election, where in everyone who is eligible to vote does so, and the winner gets the seat on the council that runs Barataria Bay. Everyone who owns a ship or a business in Barataria Bay has a voting right. 


Barataria Bay is the most diverse place in Iostria since creatures from all walks of life find themselves there for many different reasons. It’s population is 15% human, 15% tortle, 10% dwarf, 10% gnomes, 5% halfling, 5% elf, 5% tabaxi, 3% kenku, 2% tiefling, and the rest 30% of all the other races in Iostria. 

There is no official town guard or police force, since it’s more of a place of passersby, merchants and pirates. But don’t think it’s a place where you can do as you please, while it is true that certain laws are a bit more loose in Barataria Bay the laws set by the council are heavily enforced by everyone that lives there, also pretty much everyone here is armed and knows how to fight with a few exceptions of merchants and other folk.

 Most of Barataria Bay’s economy is based on piracy and the trade of stolen goods but also the exports of strong liquor made by breweries located in the Barataria Bay area, which are famous across Iostria. Although exports of hard liquor to the Kingdom can be a bit tricky because the Kingdom has banned all trade with the pirate towns. Some merchants get around this by setting up shop in Mirfield or other towns outside the Kingdom and acting as a third party to get the liquors into the cities and towns of the Kingdom.
 
 
## 5 Races
<hr style="margin-top: -2px;">

[Contents](#Contents)


### Human
Humans are the most common race in Iostria being about 40% of the total population. They can be found in most parts of the continent with a few exceptions.

Most Tieflings are colored either: black, grey, purple or black purple, Also a very small % of tieflings are also Red, but they are so rare that most people have only heard of them through stories. It is believed that a tieflings color is based on the color of their ancestral Ashen ones.
